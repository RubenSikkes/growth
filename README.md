Fitness Bulking Analysis

Stats were measured every morning after waking up and things measured included:
- Weight (kg)
- Fat Percentage
- Water Percentage
- Muscle Percentage
- Bonemass

These were filled in a google sheet which calculated muscle,fat and water mass, as well as changes in water,fat,weight and musclemass.

After processing data in RStudio final colnames are;
"Date" "Weight""fatpct""watpct""musclepct""botgewicht""musclemass""muscgain"       
"fatmass""fatgain""watmass""watgain""Wday""day_since_start" "total_gain""musc_total_gain"
"fat_total_gain""wat_total_gain""mf_gain_ratio""lean_weight""ffmi""adj_ffmi"

Questions researched include:
- How have my stats changed over time? Am I on track on going from 74 to 85kg?
- How is my bulk going respectively (muscle to fat etc)
- Are there days im slacking? 
- Whats my overall fitness level?
- When if ever will I reach 85kg?
- What is the relation between gaining more on a day for muscle to fat synthesis?
